we want you to take the snake game we've already made in this tutorial and add a spike obstacle to it. We require you to add a new spike obstacle which kills the snake whenever it hits it Each time the player goes up a level the number of spikes should increase by Starting at 1 spike for the first level and be sure to reset the spikes on a new game. We also require you to add an additional piece of text to the GUI That reads "Assignment by " and then your name. Here's how your finished assignment should look when it runs. At the bottom we had the new piece of text "Assignment by " and then your name. and when we run the game there's a new spike obstacle. if the snake hits it, it dies. also every time you go up a level you should get an additional spike. Here is a few hints to help you. 
Firstly you should make a new Spike prefab just like we did for the egg. and the rock. You'll also want to add a reference to the prefab into the game controller. And in the code You'll want to create a function to create a spike which works in a very similar method to create an egg, A kill old spikes method that works in a very similar way to kill old eggs and in Level Up you'll want to kill the old spikes and create the new spikes. and on start gameplay you'll also want to kill off the old spikes.
