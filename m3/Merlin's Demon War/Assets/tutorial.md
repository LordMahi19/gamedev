For your assignment, we want you to take the card game we've made in this tutorial
and add a new attack card to it.
If you didn't follow along and make your
own project, you can download the
finished tutorial from the Teachable website.
We require you to add the new Destruct card as described in the design doc.
This card should have a mana cost of 5 and do damage of 9 which should kill any creature.
The title of the card should just simply be Destruct and for the assignment, we
want the description to read Destroys the
enemy made by and then put your name.
Also, for ease of testing, we'd like you to
set the number of these Destruct cards
in a deck to be 6.
This Destruct should use the Art, Destroy
Art for the card and for the Audio, when
the spell is cast, it should use the Boom
sound effect.
Both of these were provided in the Art
and Audio zip files.
Also, when this spell is cast, the effect
should use the Destroy Ball graphics.
Your completed assignment should look
like this.
When I run the game, there should be a
high chance we'll get the new Destruct card.
If I take a closer look at that card,
it's got the right numbers and it's got
the name of the person who made it, in
this case, me, Matthew Dixon.
So if I just use up some of these cards
to get more mana points, now we've got 5
mana points, enough to use it.
When we use this, we should get the
purple Destruct Fireball effect and the
Boom sound effect.
It also destroys the creature.
And here are a few little hints to help
you complete your assignment.
First, we need a property type called
Destruct and you'll need a property to
set whether that card is a Destruct or not.
Also, if we look on the game controller,
you'll notice that the cards now have the
Destruct card added.
And as another hint, the Destruct Ball
graphics is also a reference here.
You'll notice if I scroll down, there are now 3 audio sources. The bottom one is the Boom one and the effect also has a reference to that Destruct Ball audio.

There will also be some questions for you to answer on the website too. If you have any questions, the details on how to contact us are provided alongside these videos on the Teachable website. Well done, you've just completed Module 3. We look forward to seeing you in our next modules.
